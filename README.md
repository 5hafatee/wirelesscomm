# Wireless Communications

This repository is currently a collection of lectures I am preparing for a short wireless communications class.  The class is intended to be for MS and PhD students in Electrical Engineering.  Right now, it only has two lectures... Sorry.  I will soon add a few more lectures.  Eventually, I may add sufficient material including problems and labs for a real course.  

# Pre-requisites

The course assumes you are familiar with digital communications at the graduate level.  There are many resources for digital communications, including some lecture notes I created for the [NYU class](https://github.com/sdrangan/digitalcomm).

Additionally, some lecture notes (and problems to be added later) assume you have access to MATLAB along with the communications, phased array and antenna toolboxes.

# Lecture Sequence
These are the first lectures that I will add to this short course
